Challenges:
    Implementing the algorithm and determining which data structures best suit the implementation of the evil algorithm
    was the greatest challenge during this project. An ordinary hangman game is very straightforward, while this one has
    to create families and determine which one will be best for dodging the guesses. Also working around maps was a bit
    tricky and I had a few problems along the way where I had segmentation faults.

Likes/Dislikes:
    I liked that we made a full-fledged game that is completely functioning. A fully fleshed out game is satisfying to
    see the end product of. I did think that the starter code wasn't too great, and it would take too much time to
    figure out how the starter code is set up before even beginning to program things. I decided on just making a
    program from scratch and try working on my object-oriented programming skills. I'm still working on it but I'm
    getting better at it.

Time spent:
    I spent around 10 hours working on this assignment.
