# Evil Hangman

> This was a project that I had done for the CSCI 262 Data Structure course at the Colorado School of Mines. It plays like regular hangman, with a catch.
> With each guess, the program tries to dodge your guesses. It will update the target word in order to try and beat you every time. 
> Think you could beat it?
